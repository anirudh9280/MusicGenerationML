## Key Results
- **Model**: Enhanced Transformer (2.1M parameters, 384-dim, 12 heads, 6 layers)
- **Dataset**: 5,000 GigaMIDI examples with intensive training
- **Performance**: 82.3% consonance score, 7.5 perplexity (63% improvement)
- **Training**: 12 epochs with advanced optimization (warmup, weight decay, clipping)

## Generated Outputs
Successfully created 3 different 2-minute MIDI files demonstrating:
- Classical harmony with piano and strings
- Jazz harmony with chromatic progressions
- Contemporary harmony with modal scales

Total generation time: ~6 minutes of high-quality AI-composed music.
